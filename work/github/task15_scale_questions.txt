What is the purpose local or local[*] in a scala code ?

Local[*] is used to run spark locally with as many worker threads as 
logical cores on your machine. The code you have given will specify a master url for a 
local to run run locally with all the threads on your machine.



What is the difference between map and flatMap ?

map and flatMap are similar, in the sense they take a line from the input
RDD and apply a function on it. The way they differ is that the function in map returns only one element, 
while function in flatMap can return a list of elements
(0 or more) as an iterator. Also, the output of the flatMap is flattened.



What are two fundamental methods of creating a RDD in spark

There are two ways to create RDDs: parallelize an existing collection and reference an external dataset.
Spark supports text files, SequenceFiles, and other Hadoop InputFormats.
RDDs support two types of operations: transformations and actions.



What is the difference between map and mapValues ?

There is a difference between the two: mapValues is only applicable for PairRDDs, 
meaning RDDs of the form RDD[(A, B)]. In that case, mapValues operates on the value 
only (the second part of the tuple), while map operates on the entire record 
(tuple of key and value)



What transformation helps us summarize data according to a key?

reducebyKey will assign key : value pairs to the data.
