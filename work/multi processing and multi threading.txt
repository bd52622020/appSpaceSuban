What is Multiprocessing?
A multiprocessing is a system which has more than two processors. 
The CPUs are added to the system that helps to increase the computing speed of the system.
Every CPU has its own set of registers and main memory however because each CPU is separate e. one CPU processor may sit idle and have nothing to process whilst the other is overloaded with specific processes the processes and recourses are shared dynamically across the processors 
However, because each CPU are separate, it may happen that one CPU may not have anything to process. One processor may sit idle, and the other may be overloaded with the specific processes. In such a case, the process and resources are shared dynamically among the processors.

Characteristics of Multiprocessing
Here are the essential features of Multiprocessing:
* multiprocessing classified according to the way their memory is organised.
* Multiprocessing improves the reliability of the system
* Multiprocessing can improve performance by decomposing a program into parallel executable tasks.

What is Multithreading?
Multithreading is a program execution technique that allows a single process to have multiple code segments (like threads). It also runs concurrently within the "context" of that process. Multi-threaded applications are applications that have two or more threads that run concurrently. Therefore, it is also known as concurrency. 

multithreading will share process space it can create multiple threads in this space but will will have their own instruction sets with there own tasks but executing there own code stack memory instruction pointer.so all global variables can have access to each thread.

multiprocessing have there own space but if they want to communicate with each other they should have to use interprocess communication techniques such as a file on the disc or a shared memory or a message file.\

multhit hreading is lightweight
processing is heavy weight

multiprocess does not effect any other programmes if it has a memory leak for example it will only affect that specific program




Characteristics of Multithreading
* In the multithreading process, each thread runs parallel to each other.
* Threads do not allow you to separate the memory area. Therefore it saves memory and offers a better application performance



Parameter	Multiprocessing	Multithreading
Basic	Multiprocessing helps you to increase computing power.	Multithreading helps you to create computing threads of a single process to increase computing power.
Execution	It allows you to execute multiple processes concurrently.	Multiple threads of a single process are executed concurrently.
CPU switching	In Multiprocessing, CPU has to switch between multiple programs so that it looks like that multiple programs are running simultaneously.	In multithreading, CPU has to switch between multiple threads to make it appear that all threads are running simultaneously.
Creation	The creation of a process is slow and resource-specific.	The creation of a thread is economical in time and resource.
Classification	Multiprocessing can be symmetric or asymmetric.	Multithreading is not classified.
Memory	Multiprocessing allocates separate memory and resources for each process or program.	Multithreading threads belonging to the same process share the same memory and resources as that of the process.
Pickling objects	Multithreading avoids pickling.	Multiprocessing relies on pickling objects in memory to send to other processes.
Program	Multiprocessing system allows executing multiple programs and tasks.	Multithreading system executes multiple threads of the same or different processes.
Time taken	Less time is taken for job processing.	A moderate amount of time is taken for job processing.

Advantage of Multithreading
Here, are pros/benefits of multithreading:
* Threads share the same address space
* Threads are lightweight which has a low memory footprint
* The cost of communication between threads is low.
* Access to memory state from another context is easier
* It allows you to make responsive UIs easily
* An ideal option for I/O-bound applications
* Takes lesser time to switch between two threads within the shared memory and time to terminate
* Threads are faster to start than processes and also faster in task-switching.
* All Threads share a process memory pool that is very beneficial.
* Takes lesser time to create a new thread in the existing process than a new process

Advantage of Multiprocessing
Here are cons/ pros of Multiprocessing:
* The biggest advantage of a multiprocessor system is that it helps you to get more work done in a shorter period.
* The code is usually straightforward.
* Takes advantage of multiple CPU & cores
* Helps you to avoid GIL limitations for CPython
* Remove synchronisation primitives unless if you use shared memory.
* Child processes are mostly interruptible/killable
* It helps you to get work done in a shorter period.
* These types of systems should be used when very high speed is required to process a large volume of data.
* Multiprocessing systems save money compared to single processor systems as processors can share peripherals and power supplies.

Multi processingg and Python 

Multiprocessing and Python the only real way to achieve true parallelism. Multithreading cannot achieve this because the GIL prevents threads from running in parallel. ... However, Multithreading becomes useful when your task is IO-bound.
